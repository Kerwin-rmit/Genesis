									<h2>Chenxing Zhou</h2>
									<p>This time Assessment 3 went well. Through smooth communication, everyone is very accepting of the content arranged for themselves. At the same time, everyone can complete their work before the scheduled date, and everyone will help each other to ensure the quality of our tasks. But we still need to start work as soon as possible. Because of the lack of team members, our overall progress has slowed down. We will correct this to ensure that future work arrangements can cope with these emergencies, so that the team’s work efficiency is not affected. . In addition, this task made me feel the speed of teamwork and the sense of belonging when working together. This made me understand that the strength of one person is not enough after all, but when you work in a team, your teammates will give you a lot of support. In the team, we need to learn to listen and tell, because everyone has a different point of view, so knowing more about the ideas of others can make us pay attention to more details.

									<p>Introduction</p>
<p>I participated in the discussion of Assignment 3 a few weeks ago and finished the Assignment on October 17th. We communicated online through MS and completed Assignment 3.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The deadline for assignment 2 is October 17th. We continued to finish the work with the other members in Assignment 2, but unfortunately, our group leader left, and the original group of 6 people became 5 people, and the tasks of each person also increased.
Following the last work, we introduced our project in more depth, we need to discuss fully, and then allocate each person's task reasonably. We need a deeper understanding of the technology needed for our project development.</p>
<p>Feeling</p>
<p>Assignment 3 is a huge task. With the departure of the team members and the loss of contact with another team member, I am worried about whether we can finish the huge task within the stipulated time.</p>
<p>Evaluation</p>
<p>I think our group did a good job in assigning tasks. We are all willing to do the work assigned to us. There was not much debate in the discussion, which pushed us to finish the task faster within the time limit.
</p>

                                    <h2>Huijoon Jang</h2>
			           <p>As we experienced a2, we were able to proceed with this assignment more easily. Each part was distributed and proceeded. Our team communicated with each other through e-mail with WeChat. However, this project was difficult to obtain information. So we helped each other through knowledge we knew each other. My team members read my part and even gave me feedback. Unfortunately, we don't have much knowledge at the moment. And I think I would have gotten better results if I had started the project early. The project was delayed a lot due to the lack of team members. Next time, if this situation occurs, it seems that we will have to deal with it quickly. For example, each person will share the parts of the person who lacks through quick communication. What was lacking was time management. Everyone was doing other assignments, so they couldn't start this assignment early, but at least they should have done part distribution quickly. Then, the absence of team members would have been solved by the team members. I learned to listen and feedback others with this assignment. </p>

									<h2>Fei Mo</h2>
									<p>Through this cooperation in the project, I understand the importance of the team when doing a project. Everyone must have everybody’s task, so that everyone’s pressure will not be so great, and I will understand and understand a direction. Learn a little deeper. And how important unity is to a team. Our team was lazy at first and everyone was indifferent. This caused our progress to be very slow at the beginning and also caused our A2 score to be very low. But in A3, we started to make progress. Individuals began to become active, they all began to actively discuss, and began to have passion. But everyone in our group is not particularly strong. For some languages, some technologies for implementing prototypes, there are defects, so we have to continue to work in this direction. In this A3, I tried my best to do the best I think, and I also thank the team members for their trust and support. I think Zhou has done a lot for our team, and I am very grateful to him.

                                    	<h2>Sam Le</h2>
									<p>Sam did not contribute to this Assessment 3 (absent) </p>
									<hr />
                                    <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
                                    <p>This project, everyone cooperated very smoothly. When studying how to realize the function of automatic translation software, everyone worked hard to find relevant information. And in the process of completing the report, everyone can clearly understand what they are responsible for, and the large amount of communication within the group also makes the content that everyone is responsible for have a higher correlation. The spirit of helping each other reduces the pressure caused by Sam not participating in this project, and everyone is willing to share the extra tasks. In terms of timing, we still have problems. Because of the absence of team members, our work starts very late. This is a bad habit. We will correct this to ensure that our work process will not be easy. Affected. At the same time, what is surprising is that after the previous cooperation, everyone understands each other better. At the same time, after clarifying the work goal, everyone can start working as soon as possible. Compared with the previous cooperation, the project is completed this time. In the process, everyone is more willing to say their own ideas instead of relying on typing. Everyone can overcome the challenges of different languages and express their opinions courageously. In this cooperation, we have all understood that as a group, each member needs to help, trust and respect each other, so that group cooperation can bring out everyone's strengths. 

In the subsequent presentations, we will continue to cheer and continue to work hard. We are very fortunate that everyone in this team will not complain about their work, and will do their best to complete it. Unity is very important for a team, because Unity will have motivation and passion. </p>
